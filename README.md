# Movie Town with React

1.  `npx create-react-app react-movie-town` create our react app project and `cd react-movie-town` and be sure to change directory into our project.

2.  Add bootstrap to our project, `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap@3`

3.  Update our `index.js` to add bootstrap as a dependency. Here is an example page of react using bootstrap [App.js](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gaearon/85d8c067f6af1e56277c82d19fd4da7b/raw/6158dd991b67284e9fc8d70b9d973efe87659d72/App.js)
