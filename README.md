# Movie Town with React

1.  `npx create-react-app react-movie-town` create our react app project and `cd react-movie-town` and be sure to change directory into our project.

2.  Add bootstrap to our project, `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap@3`

3.  Update our `index.js` to add bootstrap as a dependency. Here is an example page of react using bootstrap [App.js](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gaearon/85d8c067f6af1e56277c82d19fd4da7b/raw/6158dd991b67284e9fc8d70b9d973efe87659d72/App.js)

```js
import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css";
import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-theme.css";
```

4.  We want to fetch our Movies when the component first mounts to the DOM. We will use **Life Cycle Methods** to accomplish this.

```js
//App.js
const MOVIE_URL =
  "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?api_key=2434d246ec60c162a86db597467ef4ed&language=en-US&query=hiphop&include_adult=false&sort_by=created_at.asc&page=1"

 componentDidMount() {
    fetch(MOVIE_URL)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(payload =>
        console.log(payload)
      )
      .catch(err => console.log(err));
  }
```

We are using `fetch` to do our HTTP request, that returns a promise. So we use `.then()` and `.catch()` to handle the resolve and rejection of the promise.

5.  Now we have our movies payload, we can set the array of movie objects to state using **setState**, so our application remembers the movies for rendering.

```js
//App.js
this.setState({
  movies: payload.results
});
```

6.  Now state knows about our movies we can render the movie posters onto the page!!! `"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/" + movie.poster_path`

* We probably want to filter out movies that don't have a poster path. Don't want any broken images showing up!!

7.  Once we've got our posters rendering to the page, it's time we style them up, and get them looking nice. [Bootstrap Thumbnails](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/images/#thumbnail-divider)

* Rather than using class to leverage bootstrap, we are going to use some helpful Components to do so. `import { Grid, Row, Col, Thumbnail, Button, Clearfix } from "react-bootstrap";`
* Instead of setting `col-md-4` we will pass props to the `<Col/>` Component like so `<Col sm={6} md={4}>`

```js
//MoviePosterList
<Col sm={6} md={4}>
  <Thumbnail src={`https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/${movie.poster_path}`} alt="242x200">
    <h3>{movie.title}</h3>
    <p>{movie.overview}</p>
    <p>
      <Button bsStyle="primary">Details</Button>
    </p>
  </Thumbnail>
</Col>
```

8.  This looks good, but what's up with the holes? We need to apply a bit of Bootstrap clearfix to our row so that each row starts at the same level. We've got `<Clearfix visibleSmBlock />` or `<Clearfix visibleMdBlock visibleLgBlock />` that we want to apply after a poster, before it wraps to a new line. In this case, 2 posters for sm, and 3 posters for md and lg.
    **Conditionally rendering** is what we can use to decide when and what to add an element in.

```js
//MoviePosterList
//Here the Clearfix will only be added in the render if the first part evaluates to True. Because of the '&&'
{
  (idx + 1) % 2 === 0 && <Clearfix visibleSmBlock />;
}
```

9.  **ROUTING** Our details button! The business has asked, that rather than a modal, we take the user to a details page of the movie. `npm install --save react-router-dom`

1.  Router component for the environment youâ€™re targeting and render it at the top of your app.

```js
//index.js
ReactDOM.render(
  <Router>
    <App />
  </Router>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

2.  Now we can change the route, and conditionally render Components based on the route or URL path in the browser!!!!
